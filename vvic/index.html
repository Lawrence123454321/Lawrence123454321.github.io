            Vvic.xyz is a site of my friend, Victor. He posts random stuff there with <sub>apparently</sub>
            no reason except to mimic my site. Although he copied my navigation bar with the MIT License, 
            I still suggest you to look at his siter through this link: <a href="https://vvic.xyz">vvic.xyz</a>.
